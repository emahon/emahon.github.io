            About Me
        </h1>
        <p>
            I am a software engineer interested in data visualization and water 
            resource management currently based in northern Colorado.
        </p>
        <p>
            My experience is primarily in web and front end development.
            I have used both TypeScript and JavaScript extensively. Libraries I
            have experience with include jQuery, Bootstrap, D3.js, Google Charts, 
            and Open Layers. <br>
            I have worked across the entire stack, not just in the front end. I 
            have experience with SQL, both in writing procedures for automated use 
            and one-off scripts to fix errors. I have used both Python and C# for 
            the business logic layer. <br>
            I also have experience with cloud technologies, having used both Microsoft Azure
            and AWS.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of traditional software development, I also have experience with GIS, 
            both using QGis and ArcMap. I have developed scripts for each to help process 
            data, and I have experience with integrating data from a variety of sources.

            Toxnot is a startup with a web app that helps companies know what is in their supply chains.
            I was a full-stack developer, building new features from start to finish and debugging
            issues wherever they cropped up.

        <p>
            Natural Resources Consulting Engineers (NRCE) is a civil engineering consulting firm.
            My primary duties were assisting with investigating water right use in Montana, which
            involved delineating places of use in QGis based on the legal description, then analyzing
            aerial imagery of the places of use.

            Graduate Research Assistant at Colorado State University

        <p>
            For my master's, I worked with Dr. Mazdak Arabi to build a network solver for <a href="erams.com">eRAMs</a>
            to help determine optimal distribution of water.

            For my Principles of Engineering class at Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering, I worked 
            with a team of six to build a prototype parking space detector and indicator. My role
            was primarily working on powering all the components. <a href="studentsbparking.wordpress.com">Check it out!</a>
